# AOMI (Ansible Openstack MIdonet)

Aomi is a project originally created by Midokura Ops team, to provide Ansible playbooks to deploy/install OpenStack environments with the MidoNet networking solution, both OSS and Enterprise.

It uses Ansible playbooks of the [openstack-ansible-galaxy](https://github.com/openstack-ansible-galaxy) project, which includes roles for each individual OSt component.

This project aims to be:

* Simple
* Extensible
* Distribution agnostic
* General-purpose

Openstack Mitaka version is supported at the moment, Newton will be added soonâ„¢.

[Aomi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aomi,_Tokyo) is also an area around Tokyo Bay.
